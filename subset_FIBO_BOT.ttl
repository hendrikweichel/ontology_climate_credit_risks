As a facility, an exchange is also a place of trade associated with a particular site, i.e., stock exchange, regulated market such as an Electronic Trading Platform (ECN), or unregulated market, such as an Automated Trading System (ATS), or market data provider. Stock exchanges also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of securities as well as other financial instruments and capital events including the payment of income and dividends.

The securities traded on a stock exchange include: shares issued by companies, unit trusts, derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds. To be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, it has to be listed there. Usually there is a central location at least for recordkeeping, but trade is less and less linked to such a physical place, as modern markets are electronic networks, which gives them advantages of speed and cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is by members only.""" ;

These two simple rules get refined twofold: (1) Following modified (preceding): Same like following (preceding), however if a cash flow gets shifted into a new month, then it is shifted to preceding (following) business day; (2) Shift/calculate (SC) and calculate/shift (CS). Accrual, principal, and possibly other calculations are affected by this choice. In the case of SC first the dates are shifted and after the shift cash flows are calculated. In the case of CS it is the other way round." ,

They are defined as having the following three important properties: autonomy, interactive behavior, and adaptability. (1) Autonomy - an agent is capable of acting without direct external intervention. This includes software or other agents that have some degree of control over their internal state and can act based on their own experiences. They can also possess their own set of internal responsibilities and capabilities that enable them to act without any external choreography. This definition excludes agents that act on on behalf of (or as a proxy for) some person or thing (see AgentRole). (2) Interactive behavior - they are capable of exchanging communicating with other things in their environment. This includes, in the case of software agents, messages that can support requests for services and other kinds of resources, as well as event detection and notification. They can be synchronous or asynchronous in nature. The interaction can also be conversational in nature, such as negotiating contracts, marketplace-style bidding, or simply making a query. (3) Adaptability - an agent is capable of responding to other agents and/or its environment. Agents can react to communications and events and then respond appropriately. Software agents can be designed to make difficult decisions and even modify their behavior based on their experiences. In other words, they can learn and evolve." ,

Rather, an agent in the sense meant here is something which may or may not be subject to controls and constraints but is self-actualizing in its behavior in response to any such constraints." ;
